## 🛠 How to Run the Project:

1. **Copy Project Files**
   - Copy the **entire project folder** (including all `.C` and `.H` files) into the `BIN` sub-folder of your Turbo C installation directory.  
     Usually: `C:\TURBOC3\BIN`

2. **Open Turbo C IDE**

3. **Open the Project**
   - Go to the **Project** tab.
   - Select **Open Project**.
   - Navigate to the copied folder and open the file named `PROJ.PRJ`.
   - Or you can run the 'PROJ.EXE' which is alreay ccompiled

4. **Run the Project**
   - After loading the project, use **Ctrl + F9** to compile and run.

## 📂 Project Description

This is a **basic student course management system**, demonstrating:

- ✅ Use of **User-defined header files**
- 📁 Use of **File Handling** for maintaining a database
- 📋 Modular design with different components (`COURSE.C`, `STUDENT.C`, `MAIN.C`)

It can store, retrieve, and manage student and course-related information through simple text-based file operations.
